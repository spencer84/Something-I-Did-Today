# Something I Did Today
Something I did today (sidt) is a command-line application designed for a minimalist journaling experience. The idea of the app is to allow users to quickly write about what they have done in a given day. The app will automatically append each entry to a text file with the current date, so all that is needed from the user is a sentance or two about their day. 

## Installation
Running ```Cargo build``` from within the directory to build the binary file.

## Usage
```sidt Today I went for a walk.``` Will write the following line to the journal.txt file:
27/5/24 Today I went for a walk.
